# Landing Page Project

## Project Details

This repo is the second project in Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree program.
The project is focused on using **JavaScript** to add interactivity to a web **landing page**.

A navigation menu builds dynamically based on the number of main content sections. When clicking a menu item, the page will scroll to the selected section. In addition, the section currently being view (in the center of the viewport) has additional CSS highlighting.
